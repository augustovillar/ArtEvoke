    "title": "About ArtEvoke",
    "paragraph1": "This thesis explores how artificial intelligence can support non-drug interventions for people living with Alzheimer's disease through the use of visual stimuli and art. We present the development and integration of ArtEvoke, a prototype platform that combines large multimodal models (LMMs), large language models (LLMs), and embedding-based vector search to connect personal stories with curated artworks.",
    "paragraph2": "Building upon foundational research from a <a href='https://thesis.dial.uclouvain.be/entities/masterthesis/579c4760-996b-4b3b-ba39-3ea7caf05ab8' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Master's thesis by Augusto B. V. Silva and Marc Bejjani</a> at Université Catholique de Louvain, which benchmarked the core AI models, this work focuses on integrating these components into a functional prototype and introducing a novel clinical evaluation framework. Designed to assist memory recall and cognitive engagement, ArtEvoke generates personalized visual narratives or retrieves relevant paintings based on the user's story. A key contribution of this thesis is the platform's ability to support structured clinical sessions, enabling practitioners to capture and \"score\" patient responses to provide a metric for engagement.",
    "paragraph3": "The prototype is intended for testing in future therapeutic and research settings as a scalable support tool. We evaluate the integrated system's retrieval effectiveness using FAISS and its user interaction design with a focus on accessibility. These findings highlight the potential of AI tools to support scalable and measurable cognitive stimulation in dementia care.",

Among them was La Verja, a spirited young artist whose eyes danced with the colors of her memories. As they settled into their cozy apartment, the city buzzed with life and excitement. La Verja found solace in painting, capturing the essence of Paris in every stroke. One sunny afternoon, she painted a lively scene of the Seine River, with boats gliding past the Eiffel Tower. Her artwork soon became a cherished piece in the neighborhood, bringing joy to many.",
